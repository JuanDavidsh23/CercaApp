 * The star function. You cannot review a booking unless:

 *   · the booking is completed              (state)      → not_completed
 *   · you have not already reviewed it      (uniqueness) → already_reviewed
 *   · fewer than 30 days have passed        (time)       → window_closed
 *
 * Four conditions of four different kinds, and no role resolves them. It returns a machine
 * reason (mapped into problem+json), not a boolean, and `now` is a parameter so the
 * "window closed" test passes a date instead of faking a clock. This exact file is the one
 * the API imports at the review endpoint — the mobile app imports the same one.
