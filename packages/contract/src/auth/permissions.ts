/**
 * The permission matrix — layer 1 of authorization ("capacity").
 *
 * A marketplace of two sides has a property almost no practice API has: permissions
 * are NOT resolved by a single role. Marta teaches guitar AND hires a plumber — she is
 * both `customer` and `provider`. So an account carries a SET of capacities, and,
 * separately, a platform role (`user | moderator | admin`) in its own column — a
 * moderator also hires services like anyone, which is exactly why the two are apart.
 *
 * `can(actor, permission)` ORs the two sources. This file is the single definition of
 * the matrix; the API's CASL PolicyGuard is built from it, and the mobile app imports
 * the very same file. One place defines the rule, two enforce it.
